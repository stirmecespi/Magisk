# Synopsys Design Compiler 185: A Powerful RTL Synthesis Solution
     
RTL synthesis is a crucial step in the design flow of modern integrated circuits. It transforms the high-level description of the circuit functionality into a gate-level netlist that can be used for physical implementation. RTL synthesis must meet the design constraints of timing, area, power, and testability, while also ensuring the functional correctness and quality of results (QoR) of the netlist.

Synopsys Design Compiler 185 is a state-of-the-art RTL synthesis solution that enables users to meet today's design challenges with concurrent optimization of timing, area, power and test. It includes innovative topographical technology that enables a predictable flow resulting in faster time to results. Topographical technology provides timing and area prediction within 10% of the results seen post-layout, enabling designers to reduce costly iterations between synthesis and physical implementation. Design Compiler 185 also includes a scalable infrastructure that delivers 2X faster runtime on quad-core platforms.
     
Design Compiler 185 is the core of Synopsys' comprehensive RTL synthesis solution, including Power Compiler™, DesignWare®, PrimeTime®, and DFTMAX™. Design Compiler NXT is also available and includes best-in-class quality-of-results, congestion prediction and alleviation capabilities, physical viewer, and floorplan exploration. Additionally, Design Compiler NXT produces physical guidance to IC Compiler, place-and-route solution for tighter correlation to layout and faster placement runtime.

Design Compiler 185 supports the latest process nodes, such as 5nm and below, with advanced optimizations and technologies. For example, it employs concurrent clock data (CCD) technology to reduce total power by 12% and area by 10%, while maintaining timing. It also supports multi-voltage and multi-supply designs for low-power applications. Furthermore, it integrates with Custom Compiler™, Synopsys' full-custom solution that features visually-assisted automation technologies that speed up common design tasks, reduce iterations, and enable reuse .
     
Design Compiler 185 is a proven RTL synthesis solution that has been used by leading semiconductor companies for their most challenging designs. It offers high performance, high quality, and high productivity for today's complex ICs.
